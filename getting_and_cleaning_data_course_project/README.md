Here is my solution for the getting and cleaning data course project
Assumptions:
In my script I assume that the entire dataset has already been downloaded and unzipped, and is contained in a folder called 'UCI HAR Dataset' in the working directory with no alterations to any of the files or folder structure.
I also assume that the packages plyr, dplyr, and tidyr are already installed and loaded in the environment
